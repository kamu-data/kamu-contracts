## About

This repository contains smart contracts for interacting with the
[Open Data Fabric Network](https://docs.kamu.dev/odf/), such as Oracle API for querying off-chain
data from repositories like [Kamu Node](https://docs.kamu.dev/node/).

If you are new to Open Data Fabric and Kamu - please [start here](https://docs.kamu.dev/welcome/).

## Getting Started

### Preparation

For building contracts, we use [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry). To install, please
use [the official documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation

After that, we can start building the contacts:

```shell
npm run build
```
